      <p>
        While I currently live and work in New York City, I was born in western
        Illinois and grew up in Chicago. As a teenager my passions were fantasy
        novels and philosophy. I have a BA from Yale University, where I focused
        on intellectual history, with an emphasis on 19th and 20th century
        European philosophy. I was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa my senior year
        and graduated Magna cum laude, in the top 10% of my class.
      </p>

      <p>
        After college I did a lot of soul searching by trial and error. I
        seriously considered the Catholic priesthood, got a master's degree in
        theology, and then spent a couple of years teaching high school
        religion. I became super religious, lost my faith, and moved a few
        times.
      </p>

      <p>
        None of the careers I'd entertained up to that point really fit. I
        wanted work that engaged the systems-oriented part of my brain that so
        delighted me when I was studying philosophy in college, and I wanted a
        career that would let me grow and learn and keep developing new skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I left my job and did a coding bootcamp. As a teenager, I'd tinkered
        with Scheme while working through the early chapters of Abelson and
        Sussman's
        <a

          >Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a
        >, and picking up coding again proved empowering and enjoyable. Prior to
        my bootcamp I took some independent online courses and learned
        Javascript, basic Python, and a lot of Ruby.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bootcamp I did, AppAcademy, was 12 weeks long, and focused on
        single-page app development with React and Rails, with a reasonably
        strong focus on algorithms and data structure fundamentals. It was a
        good foundation. I was the first person in my cohort to land a job, less
        than a week after graduation.
      </p>

      <p>Since then, I've been happily chugging away as an engineer.</p>
