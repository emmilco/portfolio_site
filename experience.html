      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <img src="greta.jpeg" alt="My cat Greta, emerging from under the bed." />
      <p>
        Over the past decade, my work has largely been in the medical software
        space. At Butterfly Network I've planned, led, and contributed to a
        multitude of projects related to enterprise account management, clinical
        workflows, authentication and authorization, ecommerce integrations, and
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also did a stint at Fabric Health, where I helped launch a provider
        directory and scheduling system, led backend team meetings, and did
        technical planning and implementation for a variety of features,
        including a system for ingesting, merging, and overriding customer data
        according to customer-specific precedence rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        My very first engineering job was as the third developer on a pre-seed
        startup building an HR software platform. On that team I implemented a
        lot of the infrastructure and wrote all of the deployment scripts. I
        also built a system for collecting and displaying anonymized
        survey-based metrics for HR teams, as well as a group chat feature.
      </p>
      <h2>Things I care about, as an Engineer</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in clear and open communication among stakeholers. I think a
        blame-free culture is key to team success, and that we all work best
        when we approach our work in a spirit of humble, collaborative
        curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think abstractions are good when they are useful and easy to use, but
        that excessive DRYness can lead to brittle and unmaintainable code. I am
        very process-oriented but am also a process pragmatist. I dislike clever
        code, I prefer to "<a href="https://boringtechnology.club/"
          >Choose Boring Technology</a
        >", and I think readability is on par with performance as a concern
        developers should keep in mind when we work.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the things I'm really proud of is the way my work has contributed
        in measurable ways to help other people. At Butterfly I was privileged
        to assist in a project that deployed 1000 ultrasound devices to midwives
        in sub-saharan Africa, for use in improving gestational care and
        improving outcomes for at-risk pregnancies. While it's not something I
        particularly looked for or expected in my career as an engineer, it's
        been a privilege to be able to do good technical work and know that it's
        also serving humanitarian ends.
