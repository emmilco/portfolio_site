      <p>
        I am a huge fan of the early work of Martin Heidegger, and my master's
        thesis focused primarily on the work of Michel Foucault. I rarely get
        the chance to talk about this stuff nowadays, but will happily do so
        when given the chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a big fan of poetry. I enjoy memorizing and reciting poetry. I
        think there's a lot to be gained from ongoing engagement with poetry of
        all kinds, and I believe that the memorization of carefully chosen words
        can help each of us express ourselves more clearly and more beautifully.
      </p>
      <p>I'm a gym nut. I devote a lot of my free time to fitness and food.</p>
      <p>
        Oh, and I'm lately I've been trying to pick up German again, though it's
        hard to find time.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes that matter to me</h2>
      <p>
        I care about supporting and fostering a free, open, democratic society.
        I'm a member of the
        <a href="https://action.aclu.org/give/pm-donate-to-aclu">ACLU</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a kid, I was hugely influenced by my local PBS station. Programming
        about nature, american history, scientific research, and current events
        opened up my mind and showed me so much of the world I would never
        otherwise have known about. I am a supporter of public media and a
        member of
        <a href="https://www.thirteen.org/support/contribute/thank-you"
          >my local PBS station</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a gay man who struggled with my sexuality due to my
        ultra-conservative religious upbringing, I care a lot about providing
        crisis services to at risk LGBTQ+ youth, and am a supporter of the
        <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/fundraise/"
          >Trevor Project.</a
